This is a README file for the Comp20 Assignemnt 1: Personal Webpage
                                                   Uploaded on Github
For this Assignemnt, I correctly implemented the html files without
receiving any errors abouy syntax or missuse of elements. I did an
average job of implementing classes. I had some text that shared
simialar characterstics but because they had different "margin-top"'s 
it was hard for me to group them in one class so I had to repeat
code for different paragraphs. 

During this project I worked with Keisha. She helped with the 
Git Push.

I spent approximately 5-6 hours on this assignment. A lot of this
time was spent searching the web trying to find cool ways to make
my site look good. The rest was spent trying to learn git.
