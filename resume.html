                <p>For 8 weeks, I participated in the Medical Robots program at 
                    Shanghai Jiao Tong University. During this program, 
                    I performed research on Computer Aided Design and wrote code
                    to help improve algorithms for the creation of surgical 
                    templates.</p>

                <p> For seven weeks I participated in an intensive summer immersion 
                    program at Accenture in NY. During this program,
                    I learned about multiple career paths that I could pursue 
                    in the field computer science, and the 
                    many different opportunities coding can offer.</p>
